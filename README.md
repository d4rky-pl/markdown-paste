Markdown Paste v0.2
===================

I couldn't find any Markdown pastebin so I wrote my own. It's dead simple and right now it's not very secure (there's no spamming filter). 
It uses showdown.js to do all the parsing, for non-js browsers there is `<pre>` tag with plaintext version of the file.

Feel free to fork and send pull requests, I could use better stylesheets for example ;) These are pretty crappy...


Usage
-----

Script should be easy to deploy, but here are few pointers if something goes wrong:

1. **YOU REALLY, REALLY WANT TO SET THAT UNIQUE_PASTE_KEY IN INDEX.PHP**
2. Make sure you've set up proper chmod to /txt folder
3. Sometimes Apache has weird quirks with RewriteMode, check out if it works without it and try poking around if it does
4. Check if all $_SERVER variables are correct on your server (maybe the script needs some modifications)
5. If you find a bug, fill an issue or better yet: send me a pull request

Share buttons are connected to my AddThis account, you're free to modify them for your needs.
